    <h3>About Us</h3>

    <p>

    DHB Global is a healthcare consultancy based in Hong Kong and Beijing. Our team has 15+ years experience working with leading multinational companies in China along with 100+ hospitals and research institutions in America and 150+ more across Europe.

    We have direct access to all major personal protection equipment. All of the factories included in our database have verified certifications and test results. Our priority is streamlining large and mid-sized equipment purchases while ensuring goods meet required medical standards and preventing theft or tampering during shipping. We use cryptographic tools and blockchain technology to reinforce transparency on suppliers and document all steps in the shipping process.
